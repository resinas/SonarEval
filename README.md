SonarEval
=========

Sonar Evaluator uses the results of several metrics calculated by Sonar to create a 
[rubric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)) that can be used to automatically
evaluate students in a software design course. 

The current version is just a quick hack that was done to evaluate a project made
by students in a software design course. Nevertheless, it provides a simple fluent 
interface (or internal DSL) to specify new rubrics so that it can be reused in other 
contexts.
